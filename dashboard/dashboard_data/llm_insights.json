Additionally, the wallet has sent a significant amount of Bitcoin but has not received any. This could suggest that the wallet is being used for illicit activities such as money laundering, where funds are sent out to obfuscate their origin. The average number of blocks between output transactions is also high, which could indicate attempts to delay or disguise the flow of funds.\n\n2. This behavior aligns more closely with money laundering activities rather than other types of crypto fraud. Money laundering involves disguising the origins of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers involving foreign banks or legitimate businesses. The high degree, significant outgoing transactions, and the delay between output transactions are all red flags commonly associated with money laundering schemes.\n\n3.

This discrepancy suggests that the wallet may be engaging in some form of transaction structuring or layering to obfuscate the source of funds or to make tracking transactions more difficult. The lack of significant incoming or outgoing funds combined with the high degree centrality raises suspicion of potential money laundering activities.\n\n2.
